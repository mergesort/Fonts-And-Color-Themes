Fonts-And-Color-Themes
======================

These are fonts and color themes that I use for development in Xcode. To use them, drop them into your ~/Library/Developer/Xcode/UserData/FontsAndColorThemes folder and restart Xcode.

This theme is based off of a theme that [@rpetrich](https://github.com/rpetrich) gave me, with a slightly darker background and [Adobe's Source Pro](https://github.com/adobe/source-code-pro) font, size 13.
